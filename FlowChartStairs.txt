Detailed Flow Chart Steps
Define Structure and Dependencies

Start: Begin the project setup.
Create Directory Structure: Organize the project directory.
Create requirements.txt: List dependencies.
Create Module Functions

Data Import/Export: Implement import_data, export_data.
Data Cleaning: Implement functions like remove_duplicates, fill_missing_values.
Data Transformation: Implement functions like sort_data, filter_data.
Data Analysis: Implement functions like describe_data, correlation_matrix.
Data Visualization: Implement functions for charts and plots.
Data Reporting: Implement generate_report.
Develop Command Implementations

Cleaning Commands: Implement cleaning_cmd.py.
Transformation Commands: Implement transformation_cmd.py.
Analysis Commands: Implement analysis_cmd.py.
Visualization Commands: Implement visualization_cmd.py.
Reporting Commands: Implement reporting_cmd.py.
Import/Export Commands: Implement import_export_cmd.py.
Write Tests

Unit Tests: Create test cases for each module function.
Integration Tests: Test the integration of commands with modules.
Prepare Documentation

Create README.md: Provide an overview and usage instructions.
Create INSTALL.md: List installation steps.
Create USAGE.md: Detailed command usage guide.
Setup and Deployment

Create setup.py: Configure the package for distribution.
Create Installation Script: install.sh for setting up dependencies.
Create Deployment Script: deploy.sh for packaging.
Create Test Script: run_tests.sh for running tests.
Run and Test

Run CLI Tool: Execute commands and validate functionality.
Run Tests: Execute test scripts to ensure correctness.
Check Documentation: Verify accuracy and completeness.

Explanation of Each Step
Define Structure and Dependencies

Establish the initial setup by creating the directory structure and listing the project dependencies in requirements.txt.
Create Module Functions

Develop core functions for importing/exporting data, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, visualizing, and reporting.
Develop Command Implementations

Implement command-line commands to handle different tasks such as cleaning, transforming, analyzing, visualizing, and reporting data.
Write Tests

Create and run tests to ensure each function and command works as expected.
Prepare Documentation

Document the project, including setup instructions, usage guides, and detailed command descriptions.
Setup and Deployment

Configure the project for distribution with setup.py, create installation and deployment scripts, and prepare a test script.
Run and Test

Test the application by running CLI commands and executing test scripts to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
This flow chart helps in visualizing the overall process and ensures that each phase of the project is well-defined and executed systematically.
